	<h1 class="subheading" id="internal-tools">Google Provides Internal Tools to Facilitate Blacklisting</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">Google’s internal company systems allowed employees and managers to maintain a “block list” of other employees with whom they did not wish to interact. For example, if A adds B to her block list, B is not able to look A up in the company directory, communicate with A through the internal instant messaging system, view A’s contact information or management chain, or see A’s posts on internal social media. A and B would not be able to work together constructively on an engineering project if either person blocked the other. It is common knowledge within Google that employees were habitually added to block lists for expressing conservative political views. In these comments, employees and managers discussed using block lists to sabotage other Googlers’ job transfers onto their teams.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="noindent">When an employee was blocked by a manager in another department in retaliation for reporting misconduct, Google HR defended the practice of blacklisting co-workers, stating: “Thanks for sharing this. Co-workers are allowed to control who can access their social media accounts (like G+ and hangouts). Unless your inability to access John’s social media accounts is negatively impacting your ability to do your job, we don’t find any information to suggest that John is retaliating against you in violation of policy.”</p>
	<p>On a separate occasion, another Googler posted: “Another day, another entry on a blacklist I wish wasn’t necessary to keep.” This was reported to Google HR. Google HR responded that the employee “was just expressing his own personal opinion on who he likes working with, [therefore] we did not find his comments to violate Google policy.”</p>
	<p>At a “TGIF” [<a href="http://futureofwork.nobl.io/future-of-work/how-googles-tgif-meetings-empower-employees">Thank God It's Friday</a>] meeting on October 26, 2017, an employee directly asked executives about the appropriateness of employees keeping political blacklists. Kent Walker, the Senior Vice President of Legal, dodged the question rather than repudiating the practice of blacklisting.</p>
	<p>On September 8, 2017, a group of conservative employees met with Paul Manwell, Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s Chief of Staff, to raise concerns about the ongoing problem of politically motivated blacklisting, bullying, and discrimination at Google. This meeting was a direct response to the company’s handling of the Damore situation.</p>
	<p>The conservative employees shared their own experiences with discrimination and asked the management for three major reforms. First, they asked for clarity around communication policies, recommending that Google publish a clearer statement on what is acceptable and unacceptable employee communication, and that any and all complaints about communication be adjudicated through “a documented, fair, transparent, and appealable process.” In the meeting, the employees pointed out that company leadership was sending mixed messages on whether it was even permissible to criticize diversity policies. Second, the employees requested protection from retaliation, asking the leadership to make a public statement that conservatives and supporters of Damore would not be punished in any way for their political stances. Third, the conservative employees asked the company to make it clear that the hostile language and veiled threats directed at Damore and his supporters were unacceptable, and in the interest of making Google a healthier environment for employees of all political stripes, the managers and VPs who made such statements should retract them. On information and belief, none of these reforms ever took place.</p>
	<p>There were also meetings on the flip-side of the political coin and a final indication that the executives are uninterested in altering any of Google's policies regarding blacklisting.</p>
	<p>In or around October 2017, a number of diversity activists at Google indicated that they had met with VPs Danielle Brown and Eileen Naughton in order to ensure that they would be able to continue blacklisting and targeting employees with whom they had political disagreements. On October 22, 2017, a conservative employee asked HR to help put him in contact with company leadership to discuss the issue of targeted political harassment. This request was acknowledged by Employee Relations on October 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, Employee Relations indicated to the employee that they would not be following up on his concerns about the systemic problems he raised, and they considered the matter closed.</p>

	<h1 class="subheading" id="blacklist">Google Maintains Secret Blacklists of Conservative Authors</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">On August 26, 2016, Curtis Yarvin, a well-known conservative blogger who has reportedly advised Steve Bannon, Peter Thiel, and other members of the Trump administration, visited the Google office to have lunch with an employee. This triggered a silent alarm, alerting security personnel to escort him off the premises. It was later discovered that other influential conservative personalities, including Alex Jones and Theodore Beale, are also on the same blacklist. On or about September 15, 2016, a Google employee asked HR if the writers could be removed from the blacklist. HR refused to help with the request, and instead, reconfigured the internal system so that it was no longer possible to see who was on the blacklist.</p>
	<p>The lawsuit then shows a screenshot warning the user (presumably a Google employee) that Curtis Yarvin had entered Google premises.</p>

	<h1 class="subheading" id="termination">Google Allowed Employees to Intimidate Conservatives with Threats of Termination</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">In the midst of any heated political discussion at Google, it has become commonplace to see calls for conservatives to be fired or “encouraged to work elsewhere” for “cultural fit” reasons. Googlers are extremely proud of the fact that the company has created a “shared culture of shared beliefs” and openly discriminates against job applicants who do not share the same political ideology. One Google employee, referring to two conservative Googlers who criticized a feminist blog post in July-August 2015 stated, “maybe we should just try laying off those people. Please.” Other Google employees also suggested terminating employees with conservative values that did not comport with their own. One even suggested firing an employee twice simply to get the point across—conservatives were not welcome at Google.</p>
	<p>The lawsuit document then shows what seems to be two Google+ screenshots.</p>

	</div>

	<p class="noindent top">Many Google employees resorted to name-calling, and one called conservative Google employees that reported the discrimination they faced to Google HR “poisonous assholes.” The employee stated that Google knew who the “assholes” were, and that they could be easily replaced. Several conservative employees reported this to Google HR, but Google HR replied that this hateful rhetoric was not a policy violation.</p>

	<h1 class="subheading" id="logical">Google Was Unable to Respond to Logical Arguments</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">On November 15, 2015, a Google employee complained to Google HR regarding a highly offensive post from an employee in the Developer Product Group. The post stated:</p>

		<p class="noindent-quote top">“If you put a group of <b>40-something white men</b> in a room together and tell them to come up with something creative or innovative, they’ll come back and tell you how enjoyable the process was, and how they want to do it again, but they come up with fuck­all as a result!” (emphasis added.)</p>

	<p class="top">The Google employee stated that this statement was a violation of the Google Code of Conduct, and was creating a hostile workplace environment as it targeted Caucasians, males, and individuals over the age of 40.</p>
	<p>Google HR responded: “Given the context of the post and that [the employee’s] main point is to highlight that it is helpful to have diverse perspectives, it doesn’t appear that the post to [sic] violates our policies.”</p>
	<p>Perplexed, the Google employee responded to Google HR by replacing the term “40-something white men” with “women” and asked how that was not a breach of conduct. Google failed to respond.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/joshresponse.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="noindent top">Google’s lack of response and engagement evidenced Google’s biases and its inability to even recognize them when someone pointed them out. As demonstrated above, Google allowed individuals to insult and discriminate against political conservatives, Caucasians, and males with impunity.</p>
	<p>A perfect example of Google’s relaxed attitude toward discrimination against Caucasians and males is seen in Burchett’s G+ posts. As seen below, Burchett states that in the promotions committee which she serves on where she helps decide which T5 Engineers are promoted to the T6 level, she stated, “2/4 committee members were women. Yay! 4/4 committee members were white. Boo! 12/15 candidates were white men. Boo!” Further in the thread, Burchett highlights the divisiveness of her original post by noting that it was not fair even to talk about women when “POC” or “people of color” weren’t getting enough airtime in the discussion.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/kimburchettpost.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="noindent top">Upon information and belief, Burchett continued to make hiring and promoting decisions at Google and was not reprimanded by Google, even though Burchett’s posts were reported to Google HR and to the Senior Vice President of Legal in a formal complaint.</p>
	<p>These examples make it clear that 1) Google discriminates against conservatives, Caucasians, and males and 2) that Google has fostered an environment where this kind of mistreatment is not only allowed, commonplace, accepted—but is, in fact, encouraged, enabled, and rewarded.</p>
