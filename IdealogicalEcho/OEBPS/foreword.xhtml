	<h1 class="heading">Foreword</h1>

	<h1 class="subheading">In a nutshell</h1>
	<!--Explain why you created this e-book and how intrigued you were by the reaction from the mainstream media.-->
	<p class="noindent top">So this is my attempt to preserve the catalyst to one of 2017's most intriguing political controversies. <i>Google's Idealogical Echochamber: How bias clouds our thinking about diversity and inclusion</i> was originally an internal memo written with the intention to raise issues with the company's diversity program. The article (which I have done my absolute best to preserve as intact as possible, though I did some formatting alterations) is well researched and has footnotes and hyperlinks to external sources which are academic, encyclopedic and journalistic throughout.</p>
	<p>Shortly after publication the memo's author James Damore received backlash from fellow employees and members of the public due to the apparent leaking of the memo onto the internet at large. There were many articles written about the memo and Damore himself both supportative and critical.</p>
	<p>He was then fired from Google shortly on the 7<sup>th</sup> August 2017 and has continued to be critical of the company.</p>

	<h1 class="subheading">Who is James Damore?</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">James Damore is a former senior software engineer on Google's Mountain View campus (or Googleplex) from 2013 to 2017.</p>
	<p>Academically he has a masters in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology">Systems Biology</a> from Harvard University and claims he would have continued his degree to a PhD had he not joined Google's software engineering internship programme.<sup><a id="cit-1" href="#ref-1">i</a></sup> He also has a Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology">Molecular Biology</a> from the University of Illinois.<sup><a id="cit-2" href="#ref-2">ii</a></sup></p>
	<p>Politically, according to this memo he is a classical liberal with therefore libertarian thinking.</p>

	<h1 class="subheading">Support</h1>

	<h1 class="subheading">Critique</h1>

	<h1 class="subheading">Where is James Damore now?</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">As of January 2018, James Damore is currently suing Google alongside another former employeee David Gudeman for $ via the Supreme Court of California claiming the corporation is hostile towards white male conservatives.</p><sup><a id="cit-3" href="#ref-3">iii</a></sup>
	<p>The lawsuit makes interesting allegations:</p>

	<h2 class="subheading">Google Maintains Secret Blacklists of Conservative Authors</h2>

	<p class="noindent top">Page 37 of the lawsuit alleges that Google purposefully blacklists popular and therfore influential personalities with views considered conservative.</p>
	<p><i>On August 26, 2016, Curtis Yarvin, a well-known conservative blogger who has reportedly advised Steve Bannon, Peter Thiel, and other members of the Trump administration, visited the Google office to have lunch with an employee. This triggered a silent alarm, alerting security personnel to escort him off the premises. It was later discovered that other influential conservative personalities, including Alex Jones and Theodore Beale, are also on the same blacklist. On or about September 15, 2016, a Google employee asked HR if the writers could be removed from the blacklist. HR refused to help with the request, and instead, reconfigured the internal system so that it was no longer possible to see who was on the blacklist.</i></p>
	<p>The lawsuit then shows a screenshot warning the user (presumably a Google employee) that Curtis Yarvin had entered Google premises.</p>

	<h2 class="subheading">Google Allowed Employees to Intimidate Conservatives with Threats of Termination</h2>

	<p class="noindent top">Pages 37-39 of the lawsuit alleges that Google maliciously intimidates employees that hold and vocalise their conservative views.</p>
	<p><i>In the midst of any heated political discussion at Google, it has become commonplace to see calls for conservatives to be fired or “encouraged to work elsewhere” for “cultural fit” reasons. Googlers are extremely proud of the fact that the company has created a “shared culture of shared beliefs” and openly discriminates against job applicants who do not share the same political ideology. One Google employee, referring to two conservative Googlers who criticized a feminist blog post in July-August 2015 stated, “maybe we should just try laying off those people. Please.” Other Google employees also suggested terminating employees with conservative values that did not comport with their own. One even suggested firing an employee twice simply to get the point across—conservatives were not welcome at Google.</i></p>
	<p>The lawsuit document then shows what seems to be two Google+ screenshots.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/gplusandycarrel.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p>Followed by this Google+ post with the poster Chris Lewis also advocating for the removal of colleagues he politically disagrees with. At least twelve users endorsed this post at the time this screenshot was taken.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/chrislewisfiring.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p>The document continues with the following.</p>
	<p><i>Many Google employees resorted to name-calling, and one called conservative Google employees that reported the discrimination they faced to Google HR “poisonous assholes.” The employee stated that Google knew who the “assholes” were, and that they could be easily replaced. Several conservative employees reported this to Google HR, but Google HR replied that this hateful rhetoric was not a policy violation.</i></p>
	<p>Chris Lewis becomes more enraged stating that employees he disagrees with are expendable as suggested in this Google+ post.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/chrislewisangry.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p>Steve Johnson appears to suggest adding insult to injury by firing those who he disagrees only to rehire then fire them again as a means of humilition. This comment which is my opinion is vindictive received endorsement from at least thirty eight users at the time the screenshot was taken.</p>

	<div class="image-center">

	</div>

	<p class="noindent top">During an interview with MSNBC, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai stated "I regret that people misunderstand that we may have made this [decision] for a political position one way or another...", assumingly keeping to the narrative that Damore was dismissed for violating corporations code of conduct.<sup><a id="cit-4" href="#ref-4">iv</a></sup></p>
	<p>Sundar Pichai does not regret firing James Damore either.</p>
