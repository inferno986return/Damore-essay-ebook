	<h1 class="heading">Foreword</h1>

	<h1 class="subheading">In a nutshell</h1>
	<!--Explain why you created this e-book and how intrigued you were by the reaction from the mainstream media.-->
	<p class="noindent top">So this is my attempt to preserve the catalyst to one of 2017's most intriguing political controversies. <i>Google's Idealogical Echochamber: How bias clouds our thinking about diversity and inclusion</i> was originally an internal memo written with the intention to raise issues with the company's diversity program. The article (which I have done my absolute best to preserve as intact as possible, though I did some formatting alterations) is well researched and has footnotes and hyperlinks to external sources which are academic, encyclopedic and journalistic throughout.</p>
	<p>Shortly after publication the memo's author James Damore received backlash from fellow employees and members of the public due to the apparent leaking of the memo onto the internet at large. There were many articles written about the memo and Damore himself both supportative and critical.</p>
	<p>He was then fired from Google shortly on the 7<sup>th</sup> August 2017 and has continued to be critical of the company.</p>

	<h1 class="subheading">Who is James Damore?</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">James Damore is a former senior software engineer on Google's Mountain View campus (or Googleplex) from 2013 to 2017.</p>
	<p>Academically he has a masters in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Systems_biology">Systems Biology</a> from Harvard University and claims he would have continued his degree to a PhD had he not joined Google's software engineering internship programme.<sup><a id="cit-1" href="#ref-1">i</a></sup> He also has a Bachelor of Science in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_biology">Molecular Biology</a> from the University of Illinois.<sup><a id="cit-2" href="#ref-2">ii</a></sup></p>
	<p>Politically, according to this memo he is a classical liberal with therefore libertarian thinking.</p>

	<h1 class="subheading">Support</h1>

	<h1 class="subheading">Critique</h1>

	<h1 class="subheading">Where is James Damore now?</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">As of January 2018, James Damore is currently suing Google alongside another former employeee David Gudeman for $ via the Supreme Court of California claiming the corporation is hostile towards white male conservatives.<sup><a id="cit-3" href="#ref-3">iii</a></sup></p>
	<p>I am not versed in law so I cannot comment or speculate on the lawsuit's legal merits and chances of success or failure. However Damore's memo is included as part of the 161-page lawsuit as "EXHIBIT A" and the lawsuit also makes interesting allegations.</p>
	<p>Using my knowledge I have worked my way through several sections of the lawsuit and provided commentary, all the <i>italicised</i> paragraphs have been left unaltered (alterations are left unitalicised).</p>
	<p>At the time of writing, Google's only response to thsi lawsuit was during an interview at a performance hosted by MSNBC and Dehosted, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai stated that he didn't regret firing James Damore with the following <i>“I regret that people misunderstand that we may have made this [decision] for a political position one way or another...”</i>, assumingly keeping to the narrative that Damore was dismissed for violating corporation's code of conduct.<sup><a id="cit-4" href="#ref-4">iv</a></sup></p>

	<h2 class="subheading">Google Provides Internal Tools to Facilitate Blacklisting</h2>

	<p class="noindent top">Pages 34-37 of the lawsuit alleges that Google employees can blacklist each other, a practise I am not neccessarily against in principle as some of the methods described don't seem too disimilar to blocking other people on Facebook. However the concept of using block lists to purposefully obstruct employees that merely hold differing opinions isn't helpful. It is also a common tactic by left-wing pundits such as Steve Shives and Randi Harper to mass block those who are simply connected to other pundits they disagree with<sup><a id="cit-5" href="#ref-5">v</a></sup>. I also personally think that the term “common knowledge” isn't useful legalese as it doesn't suggest those who do it or even if its endorsed by any of Google's policies.</p>
	<p><i>Google’s internal company systems allowed employees and managers to maintain a “block list” of other employees with whom they did not wish to interact. For example, if A adds B to her block list, B is not able to look A up in the company directory, communicate with A through the internal instant messaging system, view A’s contact information or management chain, or see A’s posts on internal social media. A and B would not be able to work together constructively on an engineering project if either person blocked the other. It is common knowledge within Google that employees were habitually added to block lists for expressing conservative political views. In these comments, employees and managers discussed using block lists to sabotage other Googlers’ job transfers onto their teams.</i></p>
	<p class="bottom">The lawsuit then shows what appears to be a Google+ screenshot. From the wording described it seems Stephanie Van Dyk has a rather long block list.</p>

	<div class="image-center">

	</div>

	<p class="top bottom">Followed by this comment thread below that Google+ post made. I am curious as to who the second commenter is because this individual certainly makes an interesting point by suggesting subpoenering the blacklists from managers in the event of a hypothetical harassment lawsuit. The last commenter by engineer <a href="http://www.oshineye.com/">Ade Oshineye</a> confirms blacklisting works within the internal Google+ network (or intranet).</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/blocklistcommentthread.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="top">The document continues and confirms what we already know.</p>
	<p><i>When an employee was blocked by a manager in another department in retaliation for reporting misconduct, Google HR defended the practice of blacklisting co-workers, stating: “Thanks for sharing this. Co-workers are allowed to control who can access their social media accounts (like G+ and hangouts). Unless your inability to access John’s social media accounts is negatively impacting your ability to do your job, we don’t find any information to suggest that John is retaliating against you in violation of policy.”</i></p>
	<p>What I find problematic is the double standard here and the implication that some people's personal opinions are more valuable than others.</p>
	<p><i>On a separate occasion, another Googler posted: “Another day, another entry on a blacklist I wish wasn’t necessary to keep.” This was reported to Google HR. Google HR responded that the employee “was just expressing his own personal opinion on who he likes working with, [therefore] we did not find his comments to violate Google policy.”</i></p>
	<p>I find it concerning that a high ranking executive of any corporation's legal department can be so evasive when asked about blacklisting. Surely it's either good or bad for the corporation as a whole?</p>
	<p><i>At a “TGIF”</i> [<a href="http://futureofwork.nobl.io/future-of-work/how-googles-tgif-meetings-empower-employees">Thank God It's Friday</a>] <i>meeting on October 26, 2017, an employee directly asked executives about the appropriateness of employees keeping political blacklists. Kent Walker, the Senior Vice President of Legal, dodged the question rather than repudiating the practice of blacklisting.</i></p>
	<p>This next paragraph of the lawsuit certainly is interesting as it shows that there was alledgly dialogue between high ranking executives and conservatively minded Google employees. The demands for protection and transparency don't seem particularly unreasonable to me.</p>
	<p><i>On September 8, 2017, a group of conservative employees met with Paul Manwell, Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s Chief of Staff, to raise concerns about the ongoing problem of politically motivated blacklisting, bullying, and discrimination at Google. This meeting was a direct response to the company’s handling of the Damore situation.</i></p>
	<p><i>The conservative employees shared their own experiences with discrimination and asked the management for three major reforms. First, they asked for clarity around communication policies, recommending that Google publish a clearer statement on what is acceptable and unacceptable employee communication, and that any and all complaints about communication be adjudicated through “a documented, fair, transparent, and appealable process.” In the meeting, the employees pointed out that company leadership was sending mixed messages on whether it was even permissible to criticize diversity policies. Second, the employees requested protection from retaliation, asking the leadership to make a public statement that conservatives and supporters of Damore would not be punished in any way for their political stances. Third, the conservative employees asked the company to make it clear that the hostile language and veiled threats directed at Damore and his supporters were unacceptable, and in the interest of making Google a healthier environment for employees of all political stripes, the managers and VPs who made such statements should retract them. On information and belief, none of these reforms ever took place.</i></p>
	<p>There were also meetings on the flip-side of the political coin and a final indication that the executives are uninterested in altering any of Google's policies regarding blacklisting.</p>
	<p><i>In or around October 2017, a number of diversity activists at Google indicated that they had met with VPs Danielle Brown and Eileen Naughton in order to ensure that they would be able to continue blacklisting and targeting employees with whom they had political disagreements. On October 22, 2017, a conservative employee asked HR to help put him in contact with company leadership to discuss the issue of targeted political harassment. This request was acknowledged by Employee Relations on October 31, 2017. On December 22, 2017, Employee Relations indicated to the employee that they would not be following up on his concerns about the systemic problems he raised, and they considered the matter closed.</i></p>

	<h2 class="subheading">Google Maintains Secret Blacklists of Conservative Authors</h2>

	<p class="noindent top">Page 37 of the lawsuit alleges that Google purposefully blacklists popular and therfore influential personalities with views considered conservative.</p>
	<p><i>On August 26, 2016, Curtis Yarvin, a well-known conservative blogger who has reportedly advised Steve Bannon, Peter Thiel, and other members of the Trump administration, visited the Google office to have lunch with an employee. This triggered a silent alarm, alerting security personnel to escort him off the premises. It was later discovered that other influential conservative personalities, including Alex Jones and Theodore Beale, are also on the same blacklist. On or about September 15, 2016, a Google employee asked HR if the writers could be removed from the blacklist. HR refused to help with the request, and instead, reconfigured the internal system so that it was no longer possible to see who was on the blacklist.</i></p>
	<p>The lawsuit then shows a screenshot warning the user (presumably a Google employee) that Curtis Yarvin had entered Google premises.</p>

	</div>

	<h2 class="subheading">Google Allowed Employees to Intimidate Conservatives with Threats of Termination</h2>

	<p class="noindent top">Pages 37-39 of the lawsuit alleges that Google maliciously intimidates employees that hold and vocalise their conservative views.</p>
	<p><i>In the midst of any heated political discussion at Google, it has become commonplace to see calls for conservatives to be fired or “encouraged to work elsewhere” for “cultural fit” reasons. Googlers are extremely proud of the fact that the company has created a “shared culture of shared beliefs” and openly discriminates against job applicants who do not share the same political ideology. One Google employee, referring to two conservative Googlers who criticized a feminist blog post in July-August 2015 stated, “maybe we should just try laying off those people. Please.” Other Google employees also suggested terminating employees with conservative values that did not comport with their own. One even suggested firing an employee twice simply to get the point across—conservatives were not welcome at Google.</i></p>
	<p>The lawsuit document then shows what seems to be two Google+ screenshots.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/gplusandycarrel.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="top bottom">Followed by this Google+ post with the poster Chris Lewis also advocating for the removal of colleagues he politically disagrees with. At least twelve users endorsed this post at the time this screenshot was taken.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/chrislewisfiring.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="top">The document continues with the following.</p>
	<p><i>Many Google employees resorted to name-calling, and one called conservative Google employees that reported the discrimination they faced to Google HR “poisonous assholes.” The employee stated that Google knew who the “assholes” were, and that they could be easily replaced. Several conservative employees reported this to Google HR, but Google HR replied that this hateful rhetoric was not a policy violation.</i></p>
	<p class="bottom">Chris Lewis becomes more enraged stating that employees he disagrees with are <i>“arseholes”</i> and should be expendable as suggested in this Google+ post.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/chrislewisangry.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="top bottom">Steve Johnson appears to suggest adding insult to injury by firing those who he disagrees with only to rehire then fire them again as a means of humilition. This comment which is my opinion is vindictive received endorsement from at least thirty eight users at the time the screenshot was taken.</p>

	<div class="image-center">

	</div>

	<h2 class="subheading">Google Was Unable to Respond to Logical Arguments</h2>

	<p class="noindent top">Pages 43-45 allege that Google isn't able to make responses regarding even hypothetical situations or poorly made jokes. The supposed joke here is that 40-something white men aren't capable of creating anything meaningful however if this was true then why are so many of these people in creative positions?</p>
	<p class="bottom"><i>On November 15, 2015, a Google employee complained to Google HR regarding a highly offensive post from an employee in the Developer Product Group. The post stated:</i></p>

		<p class="quote"><i>“If you put a group of <b>40-something white men</b> in a room together and tell them to come up with something creative or innovative, they’ll come back and tell you how enjoyable the process was, and how they want to do it again, but they come up with fuck­all as a result!” (emphasis added.)</i></p>

	<p class="top"><i>The Google employee stated that this statement was a violation of the Google Code of Conduct, and was creating a hostile workplace environment as it targeted Caucasians, males, and individuals over the age of 40.</i></p>
	<p><i>Google HR responded: “Given the context of the post and that [the employee’s] main point is to highlight that it is helpful to have diverse perspectives, it doesn’t appear that the post to [sic] violates our policies.”</i></p>
	<p><i>Perplexed, the Google employee responded to Google HR by replacing the term “40-something white men” with “women” and asked how that was not a breach of conduct. Google failed to respond.</i></p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/joshresponse.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="top">My frustrations here with Kim Burchett's post is that continues to advocate diversity for the mere sake of diversity. If a white man or woman are the best candidate in terms of skills and demeanour for a position he should get it. Meritocracy should not be a dirty word in the realm of human resources.</p>
	<p><i>Google’s lack of response and engagement evidenced Google’s biases and its inability to even recognize them when someone pointed them out. As demonstrated above, Google allowed individuals to insult and discriminate against political conservatives, Caucasians, and males with impunity.</i></p>
	<p><i>A perfect example of Google’s relaxed attitude toward discrimination against Caucasians and males is seen in Burchett’s G+ posts. As seen below, Burchett states that in the promotions committee which she serves on where she helps decide which T5 Engineers are promoted to the T6 level, she stated, “2/4 committee members were women. Yay! 4/4 committee members were white. Boo! 12/15 candidates were white men. Boo!” Further in the thread, Burchett highlights the divisiveness of her original post by noting that it was not fair even to talk about women when “POC” or “people of color” weren’t getting enough airtime in the discussion.</i></p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/kimburchettpost.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="top">It seems that you can hire and promote whoever you wanted at Google as long as you met the diversity guidelines. Kim Burchett apparently no longer works at Google. For those interested in further reading about her and her colleauges, a Breitbart article <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/tech/2017/08/07/revealed-inside-googles-sjw-cabal-blacklists/"><i>REVEALED: Google’s Social Justice Warriors Create Wrongthink Blacklists</i></a> is a good place to start and is also relevant to the previous allegation of blacklisting.</p>
	<p><i>Upon information and belief, Burchett continued to make hiring and promoting decisions at Google and was not reprimanded by Google, even though Burchett’s posts were reported to Google HR and to the Senior Vice President of Legal in a formal complaint.</i></p>
	<p><i>These examples make it clear that 1) Google discriminates against conservatives, Caucasians, and males and 2) that Google has fostered an environment where this kind of mistreatment is not only allowed, commonplace, accepted—but is, in fact, encouraged, enabled, and rewarded.</i></p>

	<p class="ref" id="ref-5"><a href="#cit-5">v.</a> Mass blacklisting by left-wing pundits is something of a meme in the online sceptic community. For example, atheist and feminist Steve Shives has seemingly set up his Twitter profile <a href="https://www.twitter.com/steve_shives">@Steve_Shives</a> to automatically block those who follow accounts he disagrees with including my own personal account <a href="https://www.twitter.com/inferno986retur">@inferno986retur</a>. This has lead to the rather infamous hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/blockedbysteve?lang=en">#BlockedBySteve</a>.
