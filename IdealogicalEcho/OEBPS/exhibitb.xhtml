	<h1 class="subheading">Anti-conservative postings - 1</h1>

	<p class="noindent top">This is the first conversation thread added to <b>Exhibit B</b>, revolving around a Kermit meme stating <i>"I think all of Trump's supporters are deplorable for backing an openly racist candidate but that's none of my business."</i></p>
	<p>While I think it's dangerous to cast a group I disagree with, with the same idealogical brush I don't think this first thread is harrassment in any way. The meme's creator is part of quite a large mindset that believe without nuance that all Trump supporters must be white supremacists or at least share their values. Myself and hopefully many of those that read this know this not to be true as people voted for Trump for a plethora of reasons (such as...).</p>
	<p class="bottom">Admittedly the media and Hillary Clinton herself have played a huge role in portraying both Trump and his supporters' image. For example, I don't think Trump would have been associated with the word deplorable to any popular extent if it had not been for Hillary Clinton's <i>"Basket of Deplorables"</i> quote at a LGBT fundraiser on September 9th, 2016. The quote is notable enough to have its own <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basket_of_deplorables">Wikipedia page</a>.</p>

	<p class="quote"><i>"You know, to just be grossly generalistic, you could put half of Trump's supporters into what I call the basket of deplorables. Right? They’re racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic — Islamophobic — you name it. And unfortunately, there are people like that. And he has lifted them up. He has given voice to their websites that used to only have 11,000 people — now have 11 million. He tweets and retweets their offensive hateful mean-spirited rhetoric. Now, some of those folks — they are irredeemable, but thankfully, they are not America."</i></p>

	<p class="top">Having read the quote through several times, my only real criticism use of the word "half" which Hillary Clinton herself admitted was an incorrect use of words in her book <i>What Happened</i>. I think the real number of Trump supporters that fit this demographic are far lower and much exaggerated.</p>
	<p>As stated previously, I have no legal expertise but I from what little I do know such as the 1st Amendment offering freedom of speech to plenty of crazy ideas. I'd argue that this section is the weakest part of the lawsuit as a whole.</p>

	<p class="noindent top">This second comment by Josh Beitalspacher is much more aggregious and within the territory of actual harrassment. Particularly with the last paragraph of his comment suggesting that no conservative conversations can happen at all. If that's not a 1st amendment violation it better should be.</p>
	<p>The notorious Trump quote <i>"Grab them by the pussy."</i> is absolutely crass, vulgar and indefensible. There's no real argument there, however considering its context (and context is very important with any quote) as 'locker room banter' I do think the quote's overall importance is sensalationised by the Trump nay-sayers, there's no clear evidence I can see that Trump has grabbed any woman's genitalia unconsentially.</p>
	<p>Beitalspacher's next Trump quote was made after the Unite the Right 2017 rally on (date) in Charlottesville, Virginia. As I am sure most readers are aware, a group of right-wing to far-right people gathered to protest the removal of Charles Robert Lee's statue, a Confedarate Army general. I think there's dishonesty here with a lot of people who oppose Trump about who a lot of these counterprotesters are and how they behave. AntiFa has a brand problem it seems and while opposing facism in of itself is an acceptable cause, doing harm to those who oppose your idealogy isn't. There's also admittedly a bias against anything Confedarate related, you don't have to be American to know the Confederacy has been dead for (years) and I really do wonder how many people were hurt over the Battle Flag of North Virginia (commonly referred to as the "Confederate Flag") outside of the idiots who trepassed on other people's property to remove it.</p>
	<p>Beitalspacher's third Trump quote is certainly one of the more memorable ones. Now admittedly I don't know all the numbers, but as someone that tries to view things pragmatically I do wonder how many cross the border with good intentions. In the case of drugs, I recall watching a documentary on the US border and each border state (California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas) had a drug epidemic. Drugs such as cocaine are manufactured often in South America (even <i>Scarface</i> demonstrates this) and then brought up north. Rapists I can't answer as confidently, however if people are entering the US illegally there will have been no background check and known, convicted rapists have crossed the Mexican border into the US. Some of course would be good people looking for a better life, but is that worth compromising the border of a country for?</p>

	<p class="noindent top">Next we have the puffin meme saying the following <i>"I do think we could stand to alienate fewer conservatives</i>[,] <i> but sometimes this is intended to mean "tolerate views and actions that harm minorities". No thanks."</i></p>
	<p class="bottom">The issue with this meme is that it outright states without nuance that conserative viewpoints could never benefit minorities and that liberal views can only benefit them and therefore 1st amendment principles should be violated based on that. The meme's content is more of a logical fallacy to me than anything else.</p>

	<p class="noindent top">Next we have a Google+ post with a single comment that is basically one big wagon of stereotypes. It's silly, but I don't think it's a 1st amendment violation.</p>
	<p>First and foremost, where did this poster get the figures from to comfortably say "majority"? Is this based on hard data or is it just their opinion? I am going to assume the latter. The notion that you have to be a Christian to be a Republican is actually laughably false, yes there are plenty of conservatively minded Christians but I'll have you know that liberal Christians also exist and plenty of atheists would have voted for Trump. Myself included. Yes, I think it's most probable that deities don't exist and that the Earth is a several billion year old, near-spherical celestial object that rotates around the sun.</p>
	<p>Humourously, the poster then uses "logical deduction" to suggest that most Republicans are infact idiots (I don't know that works either). However there is some redemption in this post when they suggest not to single out individuals. Every cloud.</p>

	<div class="image-center">
		<img class="image" src="images/exhibitb/republicantheists.png" alt=""/>
	</div>

	<p class="top">The next meme was created with the Philosophical Velocirapotor template with the following text <i>"Do you ever wish you were a corporation or a fetus, so that Republicans would finally treat you like a human being?"</i> As with many of these posts I don't see it being particularly problematic in of itself and there is nothing here the 1st amendment wouldn't protect to my knowledge.</p>
	<p>I don't think it should be such a taboo idea to suggest that a foetus is a human being when all human beings originated as foetuses. I appreciate the concept of abortion is probably one of the trickiest dilemmas possible, but I agree with those that suggest we shouldn't dehumanise the situation. Some Republicans actually criticise corporatism as being overly controlling, particularly in an era where Twitter allegedly bans those it disagrees with. Most however agree on defending the free market.</p>
